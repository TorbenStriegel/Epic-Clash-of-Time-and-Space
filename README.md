## Game Description
Enter the world of Epic Clash of Time and Space and find yourself aboard a wrecked starship on an unknown, hostile world far from home. Guide the members of your crew as they try to get your ship flying again.

Establish your base amidst the ancient ruins of an alien civilization and spend your days searching the area for valuable resources before night falls. As the sun goes down, the rightful inhabitants of this planet will come out of their hiding places and do their utmost to destroy you and your crew along with your ship. The longer you manage to fight against these monsters, the more angry and dogged your opponents will become, who are far superior to your crew in numbers.

It all depends on the right strategy. Decide which walls you can fortify best and how many resources you have left from the day's yield to repair the damage to the spaceship or clone more crew members. One thing is clear: You and your crew cannot stay on this world forever. Sooner or later you will be defeated if you do not flee.

Will you be able to leave this hostile hell world with a repaired ship? Or will you lead your crew into the doom and allow your enemies to destroy the ship for good?
